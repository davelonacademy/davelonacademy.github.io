		<h1>About Davelon Academy</h1>
	  
    <p>Davelon Academy was started to train and inspire future data thinkers — people who can use data with skill, clarity, and purpose. 
		It is built on decades of hands-on consulting and real-world training experience in database systems and performance engineering.
		<br>
		<br>
		Davelon academy continues the legacy of SkandanDB — a consulting firm known for solving deep Oracle performance issues — and is led by A. Senthil Nathan, a specialist in database performance, tuning, and scalable system design.
		<br>
		<br>
		At Davelon, we offer focused, practical training in:
		
		<ul>
			<li>Database Optimization</li>
		
			<li>Data science and Data Translator</li>
		
			<li>Machine Learning</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Davelon is among the first academies in India to recognize the importance of training professionals who can bridge the gap between technical teams and business goals. Our approach to Data Translation is practical, hands-on, and designed to create clear communicators who understand both data and decision-making.</p>
